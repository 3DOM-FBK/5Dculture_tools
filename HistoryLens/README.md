Within this repository, a Unity project template using the **ImmersalAR** library is available. This library makes it possible to precisely determine the pose of a device and supports the navigation and display of content in **Augmented Reality (AR)**. For further information and insights into the library, please refer to ([official documentation](https://immersal.com/)).

The template includes a default interface, already configured, which can be customised according to your needs. The interface was developed using the new **Unity UI Toolkit** plugin, providing greater flexibility and modularity in the management of the user interface.

To facilitate the use of the template, a **demo scene** has been included that can serve as a reference for the development of your use case. The scene contains a map generated with the **ImmersalAR** library and three photographs placed at specific points on the map, which can be viewed in AR mode. 

This template provides a solid basis for the creation of custom AR applications, simplifying the integration of the ImmersalAR library and the implementation of modern and efficient user interfaces.
